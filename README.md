# PaymentSystemApi

Demo for Payment System Api

I created a loop to get account detail with random generated data and use linq to order the account transaction to newest date.
Adding unit test to the project to check if the conditions are met.

For status property my assumption is that it has 3 value which is Success,Failed,Closed.

Success - If the payment or calling the API is successful
Failed - If the transaction to API is failed.
Closed - If the success transaction is now posted to the system.

For you to see this in action.
Clone my repository and run it to your local or deploy it IIS.

If you have any suggestion for the improvement please let me know.

Thanks and Enjoy.
